# GaussianEliminationHelper
Helps avoid math errors when working on simple systems of equations with augmented matricies

This is NOT a calculator. This is a tool to help students focus on the concepts of solving systems of linear equations with Gauss-Jordan elimination to get row-reduced echelon form. Becasue elementary row operations are carried out by the program, the user can simply focus on which operation will solve the matrix, rather than mostly worrynig about mathematical errors. This program uses three classes; MatrixHelperDriver (main), Matrix (the class that carries out matrix operation and holds the matrix as a 2d array), and a Fraction class (to reduce fractions when doing simple arithmetic and avoid the most common loss of accuracy associated with floating point number division).
